 Kidney-Cancer-Prediction-Model.
 
•	The main objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of kidney cancer in patients using clinical and physiological data. 

•	The dataset used contains patient information including age, blood pressure, blood urea, serum creatinine, hemoglobin levels, sugar level, and tumor size, along with a binary target column Kidney_Cancer indicating the presence or absence of the disease.

•	Data preprocessing steps include checking for and handling missing values, normalizing the numeric data using StandardScaler, and splitting the dataset into training and testing subsets to prepare it for modeling.

•	Random Forest Classifier is used as the predictive model because of its high performance, ability to handle both linear and non-linear patterns, and ease of interpretability through feature importance scoring.

•	Model evaluation is done using common classification metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score, along with visualizing feature importance to understand which features contribute most to prediction.

•	The project is structured in an organized way, with separate folders for data, source code, saved models, and performance reports, reflecting real-world software engineering practices.

•	The final output includes the trained model saved as a .pkl file, a PNG image showing feature importance, and performance reports summarizing how well the model performs on unseen data.
