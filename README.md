#Kidney Cancer Prediction Model.


1. This project aims to predict kidney cancer in patients using medical data with a machine learning model.

2. It uses features like age, blood pressure, blood urea, serum creatinine, hemoglobin, sugar level, and tumor size.

3. Data is cleaned, scaled, and split into training and testing sets for model preparation.

4. A Random Forest Classifier is used for prediction due to its accuracy and feature importance capabilities.

5. Evaluation is done using accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.

6. The project follows a real-world structure with organized folders for data, code, models, and reports.

7. Outputs include a trained model file, feature importance chart, and performance summaries.
