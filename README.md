 Kidney Cancer Prediction Model.
 
•	This project aims to predict kidney cancer in patients using medical data with a machine learning model.
•	It uses features like age, blood pressure, blood urea, serum creatinine, hemoglobin, sugar level, and tumor size.
•	Data is cleaned, scaled, and split into training and testing sets for model preparation.
•	A Random Forest Classifier is used for prediction due to its accuracy and feature importance capabilities.
•	Evaluation is done using accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.
•	The project follows a real-world structure with organized folders for data, code, models, and reports.
•	Outputs include a trained model file, feature importance chart, and performance summaries.
